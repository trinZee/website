            <h1>About ME</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>BAIZID</strong>. I am 17 years old. My final exams just ended so i now i had 3 month that i dont have anything that i could do really thats why i decided that it might be a good idea to learn something new. So its been two weeks since i started learning code and so far i managed to learn only HTML. So this is just a project that im creating with the knowledge that i gain while learning basic HTML</p>
